### Close-Up of DHT11 Sensor Connections:

![D64C1FB2-456F-4D7E-B354-C279F4FE1978](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryGBBcbvC.jpg)

As presented the DHT11 sensor is connnected with power to the + line, by the red jumpercable, which is supplied with power from the Raspberry Pi Pico W. It has connecetion to ground the same way by the black jumperwire. The green jumpercable supplies the data to the Pico W to GP15 pin.


## Close-Up of Soil Moisture Sensor Connections:


![FCDFE6CF-E733-4253-8AC4-F2FF31C49A2D](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rybDUqbDA.jpg)


The soil moisture sensor is supplied with power and is connected to ground in the same way the DHT11 sensor is. The data is being sent from sensor to Pico W a little bit different, it is an I2C sensor so its connected with 2 jumperwires as the picture presents one green and one white. Theese are separate and needs to be rightfully declared to get the data. White cable connects the SDA output and is connected to the pico through GP12, which as you can see in the Raspberry Pi Pico W pinout diagram is created to suit the SDA output. The green jumpercable is connected to the sensors SCL output and is connected to the corresponding SCL pin on the Pico W, which is GP13.


## Electrical Calculations

To ensure that the current and voltage requirements of all sensors do not exceed the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico W, we need to consider the power consumption of each component.

### Power Consumption

### Raspberry Pi Pico W

Operating Voltage: 3.3V
Current Consumption: ~100 mA (depending on the workload and peripherals connected)

### DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor

Operating Voltage: 3.3V
Current Consumption: ~2.5 mA (average during measurements)

### STEMMA Soil Moisture Sensor

Operating Voltage: 3.3V
Current Consumption: ~10 mA (during measurements)
Total Power Consumption
Total Current Consumption:

Raspberry Pi Pico W: 100 mA
DHT11 Sensor: 2.5 mA
STEMMA Soil Moisture Sensor: 10 mA
Total: 100 mA + 2.5 mA + 10 mA = 112.5 mA

Voltage Supply: 3.3V

The total current consumption of 112.5 mA is well within the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico W, which can handle up to 500 mA on its 3.3V rail. This ensures that our sensors can operate reliably without overloading the microcontroller.

Here are a visual representation of the notifications sent by Adafruit by email. Values of data is manipulated by me to actually trigger the notification, so disregard them.


With the triggers and actions specified like above emails will be sent out when values are not suiting the plant, theese can be customized to ones own preferences.
